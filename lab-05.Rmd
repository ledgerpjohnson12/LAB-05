### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

The bars are not to scale and the number for Chinese is misleading. Disrespecting data and people





## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

With no measurements the plot is a bit ambiguous- data and mathematics




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```
No scales- mathematics




## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

The groupings are a bit odd- data




# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data? Wide format have variables as each of the columns, long format has all the variables in a single column.


Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*? Wide


How many observations are there in the data set? 5 observations




## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}


staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c('1975', '1989', '1993', '1995', '1999', '2001', '2003', '2005', '2007', '2009', '2011'), 
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
   )

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 3 here
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()


```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()
#Probably requires a continuous variable to connect the line


```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}


staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```


```{r working-line-plot}
ggplot(staff_long,
       aes(year,
           percent,
           colour=faculty_type))+
  geom_line()



```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 6 here




```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* Idea 1
* Idea 2
* Idea 3
* ...


## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
# Write your code for Exercise 8 here



```
